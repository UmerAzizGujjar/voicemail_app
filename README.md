 App Name: Voicemail App

 Purpose:
The Voicemail App is designed to act as a modern voicemail system for users who frequently miss calls. When a user is unavailable, the app automatically picks up the call, plays a pre-recorded message, and allows the caller to record a voice message. The user can later listen to the recorded messages at their convenience. This app is ideal for busy professionals, individuals who prefer voicemail over text messages, and anyone who wants to ensure they never miss important calls.

 Target Audience:
- Busy Professionals: Individuals who are often in meetings or unable to answer calls.
- General Users: Anyone who wants a reliable voicemail system.
